Today  I tried  a little bit of vagrant and have lots of fun.
1) install virtual box first from :https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

1) goto http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads download your image and install it
2) create a folder you want to contains the vagrant file of the image, say ~/vagrant/ubutut12.04

3)  vagrant init hashicorp/precise32
4)  vagrant up

bug : 



When I set up a multi VM environment with lucid64 boxes, which I provision either with shell or puppet, I always get the following error when provisionning
stdin: is not a tty
Fix is 

@bradfeehan thank you so much for writing this up! I tried config.ssh.shell = "bash -c 'BASH_ENV=/etc/profile exec bash'" and it worked :)

create your own Provisioning

make sure 
Form

config.vm.provision :shell, :path => "provision.sh"

to 
config.vm.provision "shell", path:  "provision.sh"


And the other configurations in the VagrantFile
# -*- mode: ruby -*-
# vi: set ft=ruby :

VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION = "2"

Vagrant.configure(VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION) do |config|

   config.ssh.shell = "bash -c 'BASH_ENV=/etc/profile exec bash'"

   config.vm.box = "hashicorp/precise32"
   config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.8.81"
   config.vm.hostname = "hadoop-master"
   config.vm.provision "shell", path:  "provision.sh"
